        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>While browsing the web, I came across a website selling x-ray products. I decided to use this website for my Responsive Redesign project, in which I redesigned a website for better usability and accessibility, making sure it is responsive to different screen sizes. 
            I chose this website because there are a lot of different layout and styling decisions that I would change. In particular, the organization of the different elements on the page could be rearranged for better visual tracking and current color and contrast choices pose several accessibility issues.

    <div class="observations" aria-label="Observations section">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>White search bar pops the most, disrupting principle of left to right</li>
            <li>Affordances implying clickability such as the raised PNWX logo and the arrow icon, which users might associate with conventional “next” buttons
            </li>
            <li>All of the elements are centered and condensed in the center of page, very large margins on left and right</li>
            <li>Cheap clip-art images look unprofessional </li>
            <li>The affordances allowing you to click on any of the logo images next to the items is counterintuitive- all the different options are represented by the same clipart
            </li>
            <li>No spacing/padding between logo and text
            </li>
            <li>No logical grouping of the two columns
            </li>
            <li>Poor color and contrast choices- not properly used to direct view to certain parts of the page
            </li>
            <li>Contact info and location should be at top of page or something the user’s attention is brought to</li>
        </ul>

    <div class = accessibility aria-label = "Accessibility section">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            The page does not use any sort of heading structure or text hierarchy. All of the text is relatively the same size and color with no differing HTML tags. This, along with the lack of alt text for the images and lack of ARIA labels pose significant accessibility issues for visually-impaired users. Consistent with WAVE’s evaluation of the website’s accessibility, the contrast issues were a glaring issue upon first glance.

            <h2>Major Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This redesign project emphasizes the importance of visual cues in the context of directing a user’s attention through their navigation of a webpage. Having text hierarchy through styling choices like grouping, color, fonts, and lines is important for helping users to make certain associations. For example, the original website uses primarily black text for everything, even the links. This makes it hard for users to differentiate between the text on the screen, possibly leaving them confused on what to prioritize. The original website has everything centered and condensed into the center of the page, leaving large margins on the left and right. While this strategy allows for the page to be displayed on smaller screens pretty easily (all the content in the middle fits in a tablet/mobile-shaped frame), this is not great utilization of the space and could hinder the user’s tracking of content on the page. 
            <br></br>    
            The use of color is also an important component of this project. While I appreciate the original design’s effort to apply realism in choosing the background color, I found that the background choice was visually distracting and straining to the eyes. It also made it very difficult to apply sufficient contrast with the text, which is an important accessibility concern for visually-impaired users. While considering affordances, it is also important consider if there are any unintentional implications, such as the original site’s buttons and logos.</p>
